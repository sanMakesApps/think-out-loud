## Architecture

This app uses a **smart/dumb component architecture** for optimal separation of concerns:

| Layer | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `useSpeechRecognition` | Custom hook for handling voice input |
| `useTimer` | Custom hook for session time tracking |
| `getTranscriptActions` | Logic for downloading and clearing transcripts |
| `SpeechToText.tsx` | Presentational component — purely renders UI |
